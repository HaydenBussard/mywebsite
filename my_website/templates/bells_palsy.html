            <div class="card-body">
                <p>I only had 1 symptom/ warning... the day before my Bell's Palsy onset, I experienced persistent, low-pitched ear ringing.</p>

                <p>Unlike some who experience gradual facial paralysis, mine occurred suddenly overnight. I woke up unable to blink my right eye or move that side of my face.</p>

                <p>Despite the shock, being aware of Bell's Palsy helped me stay calm. I can't imagine how frightening this would be for those unfamiliar with the condition.</p>

                <p>My doctor advised waiting it out, assuring me that Bell's Palsy is typically temporary. Improvements usually start in 2-3 weeks, with full recovery in 2-6 months.</p>

                <p>However, 14 months later, I still have Bell's Palsy. I saw no improvement for the first 4 months, which indicated a longer recovery ahead.</p>

                <p>While not impossible to live with, Bell's Palsy can be annoying and embarrassing. Here are two crucial tips for those newly diagnosed:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Socialize with loved ones. Their acceptance will help you maintain confidence in public.</li>
                    <li>Protect your affected eye. I've linked helpful products below.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>I used goggles from day one for showering to keep soap and water out of my eye.</p>

                <p>The only true difficulty even today is being around loud noise. But fortunately above I linked the last earplugs you'll ever need. Truly though, the noise sensitivity part of Bell's Palsy is tough. I tried going to an outdoor concert early on with Bell's Palsy and that's when I learned how bad I needed to find quality earplugs because I had to leave before the opening act ended.</p>

                <p>Over time, my improvements reached a point where most people don't notice I have Bell's Palsy. It's only noticeable in certain circumstances, like squinting in sunlight or laughing.</p>

                <p>For me, after my muscles went so long without movement, I developed a muscle memory issue. My eye on the affected side closes on its own when I'm laughing hard, chewing food, or yawning. The food chewing, as you might guess, means my eyelid is in perfect harmony with my chewing pace. I won't lieâ€”it's embarrassing. However, I know that physical therapy is an option to retrain those muscles.</p>
