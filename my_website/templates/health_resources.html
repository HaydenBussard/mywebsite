            <p class="card-text">
                I created this section of my website because I understand firsthand how limited resources can be for certain health issues, particularly Lyme Disease and Bell's Palsy. My goal is to provide a comprehensive collection of information, resources, and personal experiences in one place for those who may be struggling with these conditions.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                By sharing my own experiences, I hope to convey that I truly understand the challenges you may be facing. Whether you're looking for information, support, or simply someone who understands, you've come to the right place.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
