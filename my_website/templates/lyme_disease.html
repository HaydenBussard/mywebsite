                <p>I first experienced Lyme symptoms in early June 2023. Notably, I never saw a tick or bite mark. The initial symptom was an unusually high level of soreness throughout my body. As an active person, soreness wasn't uncommon, but this was pervasive and relentless. I rationalized it as a result of intensifying my workouts for summer and for the surprise proposal I had planned for July.</p>

                <p>By mid-June, the soreness had evolved into pain, primarily in my back during the day and throughout my core at night. Sleep became elusive, ranging from zero to 2 hours per night.</p>

                <p>Seeking medical help, I explained my increased training regimen to my doctor. They diagnosed costochondritis and prescribed a steroid. While it alleviated the core pain, sleep remained impossible.</p>

                <p>Over the next weeks, I experienced constant fatigue, frequent migraines, and persistent back pain. I also noticed circulation issues in my arms. Most troublingly, brain fog set in. I struggled to process information and became easily disoriented, leading to anxiety and depression.</p>

                <p>On July 6, 2023, after another sleepless night, I awoke with Bell's Palsy (right facial paralysis). This led to the Lyme diagnosis.</p>

                <p>Post-treatment, I felt relatively better but still far from normal. Despite my doctor's assurance that "Lyme should be gone," I continued to struggle with fatigue, sleep, back pain, and brain fog.</p>

                <p>Unwilling to accept this new reality, I turned to social media and the internet for help. I discovered supplements that improved my condition and learned how to manage my symptoms better. However, as someone accustomed to constant self-improvement, I struggled with the newfound limitations and fatigue, which fueled my depression.</p>

                <p>Fortunately, I learned the importance of consistency in recovering from Lyme disease. For someone unfamiliar with Lyme symptoms, this might sound easy. But if you know, you knowâ€”it's not. If you can persevere and take the right supplements, eat nutrient-dense foods, avoid junk food and alcohol, and maintain a regular sleep schedule, you'll start to feel better. Take it from me, deviating from this comes with a price, and you may struggle for a few days until you recover again.</p>

                <p>The time I really set myself back, however, I remember feeling oddly relieved. Even though I felt horrible at that moment, I realized I was in complete control. Since then, I've been able to maintain my six-day-a-week weight lifting routine and live my life 100% normally... minus the occasional chocolate binge.</p>

                <p>This experience motivated me to create this part of my website. If you're going through something similar, check out the Helpful Resources below for social media accounts, supplements, and other resources I found beneficial.</p>
